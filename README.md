# Cat Breed Gallery

## Description
Cat Breed Gallery is a responsive web application that displays a wide variety of cat breeds using the Cat API. 
The project started as an **assignment**, but I developed it further with additional features to make it more usable and interactive.

This project showcases my expertise in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, as well as building modular, simple-to-use web applications.
